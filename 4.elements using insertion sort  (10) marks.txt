4.	Write a Python program to sort array elements using insertion sort algorithm.
Ans:
def insertion_sort(arr):
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1

        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1

        arr[j + 1] = key

# Test the program
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
insertion_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
